<h1>here is my header for all the world to seeee!</h1>
<h3>here is my smaller header for hopefully less of the world to see?</h3>

<p>Here is more information that I would like some of the world to see if they are able to read it. I know humans are in such a rush these days that these things may be difficult to follow up with.  However, if you slow down justtt enough, I believe at the end of the day everything gets done that was needing to. Life reminds me over and over again that it actually has a beautiful way of working itself out when we let it.  I say go into each day with what matters in your heart, drink coffee and let history happen! My goal is just to say at the end of it all, life was fun. (this is not a cry for help btw) </p>
<ol>reasons I typed out the above info instead of copying/pasting lorem:
    <li>lorem is ugly. i mean, the cupcake lorem is better but it's not good enough <em>to me</em></li>
    <li>I like that I feel like I'm getting to have a conversation with myself rn. here for all of that.</li>
    <li>html is fun! like this may be the beginning of the end of what I understand in bootcamp! I want to make the most of it! &#128512 KIDDING.</li>
</ol>
